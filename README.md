# Real world object measurement with OpenCV
# Project tasks
- Calculate the necessary working space and working distance of camera for your task. Comparing the calculated and the real data of working space and working distance
- Chose a shaped object. Calculate pixel coordinate and angle of object.
- Perform camera calibration and calculate the real coordinate of object in world coordinate.
- Doing image processing to recognize feature of object and then calculate the dimension of object.
# Project results
- The results and the procedures are explained with detail in the attached PDF file
- To calibrate the camera with Zhang's method, Matlab Camera calibrator app, Python or C code can be used, depending on user. In my case, the Matlab app is used for its quickness and precision.
- The measuring errors is pretty small comparing to the object's size.
